This archive is maintained by Paul Edwards, fidonet 3:711/934.

It contains a selection of public domain programs that have
crossed my path.

An index to all files can be found in ozpdndx.txt

OZPD is similar to SNIPPETS, which is maintained by Bob Stout.
The reason for this "rival" archive is

1) Bob keeps deleting stuff from SNIPPETS.
2) Bob only includes stuff that he thinks is useful for demonstration
   purposes, whereas I see this as the start of a suite of PD subsystems.

OZPD stands for "Australian Public Domain", but this does not imply that
all the stuff that is in here is Australian-written, just that it is
being maintained by an Australian, and is a way of distinguishing it
from SNIPPETS.  By the way, don't blame me for the name, someone 
suggested "OZ Snippets", but seeing as I only have 4 characters for 
the name, I made it OZPD.  


Distribution:

OZPD is distributed as a file called OZPDxxyy, where xx is the
two-digit year, and yy is the two-digit month.

OZPD may be FREQ'd from my BBS.

It is also hatched into the PDOMAIN TIC echo, but at time of writing,
that echo only goes to various places within Australia.

Have fun,
